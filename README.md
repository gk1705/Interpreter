# Interpreter
Project designed to interpret a simple programming language. It includes components for lexical analysis (tokenization), parsing, abstract syntax tree (AST) construction, and interpretation.

## Core Components:
* **Lexer:**
	- Tokenizes the input string into a sequence of tokens.
	- Identifies various token types including identifiers, numbers, and operators.
* **Parser**
	- Parses tokens into an AST.
	- Implements parsing methods for expressions, terms, and control flow constructs.	
* **Interpreter:**
	- Core of the interpreter that evaluates AST nodes.
	- Supports operations like arithmetic, conditional evaluation, and variable assignment.

## Dependencies
* **Visual Studio:**
	- Project is set up to be developed with Microsoft Visual Studio.
